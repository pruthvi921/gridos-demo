# GridOS Platform - Production-Ready GitOps Infrastructure

## 🎯 Overview
A **production-ready GitOps pipeline** for the GridOS platform, demonstrating with **complete automation** and **zero manual intervention**.

### What Makes This Special

✅ **Fully Automated** - Single click deploys entire infrastructure + GitOps stack  
✅ **GitOps Methodology** - Git as single source of truth, pull-based deployment  
✅ **Progressive Delivery** - Canary deployments with automated Prometheus analysis  
✅ **Zero Manual Commands** - No kubectl/helm commands needed after initial setup  
✅ **Production-Ready** - High availability, security, observability built-in  
✅ **Interview-Ready** - Complete documentation + working demo  

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Version Control** | GitHub | Single source of truth |
| **CI Pipeline** | GitHub Actions | Build, test, push to ACR |
| **CD Pipeline** | Argo CD | GitOps-based deployment |
| **Progressive Delivery** | Argo Rollouts | Canary with automated analysis |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform + Helm | IaC for Azure + GitOps tools |

### 

**⚡ Fully automated infrastructure deployment with approval gates!**

infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform with a modular, reusable approach across dev, test, and production environments.

designed a modular Terraform setup to ensure reusability, consistency, and environment isolation.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform Modules

#### Networking Module
- VPC/VNet with public and private subnets
- NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
- Network Security Groups with least privilege
- Service endpoints for Azure services

#### Kubernetes Module
- AKS/EKS cluster with auto-scaling node pools
- RBAC configuration with Azure AD/AWS IAM integration
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- Cluster autoscaler and metrics server

#### Database Module
- PostgreSQL Flexible Server with high availability
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Private endpoint connectivity
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

#### Monitoring Module
- Prometheus with long-term storage
- Grafana with pre-configured dashboards
- Loki for centralized logging
- AlertManager with PagerDuty integration



## 🏗️ Architecture

### GitOps Flow
The system automatically deploys changes from Git to Kubernetes with metric-based canary deployments and automatic rollback

```
Developer
    ↓ git push
GitHub Repository (Source of Truth)
    ↓ webhook
GitHub Actions (CI)
    - Build Docker image
    - Run tests
    - Push to Azure Container Registry
    - Update Kustomize image tag
    ↓ commit
GitHub Repository (Updated manifests)
    ↓ poll every 3min
Argo CD (GitOps CD)
    - Detect drift
    - Auto-sync cluster
    ↓ kubectl apply -k
Argo Rollouts (Progressive Delivery)
    - Canary: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
    - Prometheus analysis at each step
    - Automatic rollback on failure
    ↓
Azure Kubernetes Service
    - Application Gateway ingress
    - HPA (2-10 pods)
    - Full observability
```


## 🔄 How It Works

### Example: Deploying a New Feature

1. **Developer makes change:**
   ```bash
   # Edit code, commit, push
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions (CI) runs automatically:**
   - Builds Docker image: `gridos-app:v1.0.1`
   - Runs unit tests + integration tests
   - Scans for vulnerabilities
   - Pushes to Azure Container Registry
   - Updates `applications/gridos/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     images:
       - name: gridosacr.azurecr.io/gridos-app
         newTag: v1.0.1  # ← Updated by CI
     ```
   - Commits change back to Git

3. **Argo CD detects change (within 3 minutes):**
   - Polls GitHub every 3 minutes
   - Detects manifest change
   - Status: "OutOfSync"
   - Auto-syncs (applies new manifests to cluster)

4. **Argo Rollouts executes canary:**
   ```
   00:00 - Deploy canary pods (v1.0.1)
   00:01 - Route 10% traffic to canary
   00:01-00:31 - Prometheus analysis (30s)
           ✓ Success rate: 99.5% (>99% required)
           ✓ Latency p95: 420ms (<500ms required)
           ✓ Error rate: 0.2% (<1% required)
   00:31 - ✓ Pass → Promote to 25%
   00:31-01:01 - Analysis (30s)
   01:01 - ✓ Pass → Promote to 50%
   01:01-01:31 - Analysis (30s)
   01:31 - ✓ Pass → Promote to 100%
   01:32 - 🎉 Rollout complete!
   ```

5. **If any analysis fails:**
   - ❌ Automatic rollback to stable version
   - Canary pods terminated
   - 100% traffic to stable
   - GitHub status updated: "Deployment failed"
   - Zero downtime maintained


## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build & Test**
   - Restore dependencies
   - Compile application
   - Run unit tests with coverage
   - Build Docker images

2. **Security Scanning**
   - SAST with SonarQube
   - Container scanning with Trivy
   - Dependency vulnerability check (Snyk)
   - Secret detection with GitLeaks

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Deploy to ephemeral test environment
   - Run integration tests
   - Database migration tests
   - API contract testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Terraform infrastructure validation
   - Helm chart deployment
   - Blue-Green deployment strategy
   - Smoke tests post-deployment

5. **Verification**
   - Health check validation
   - SLO compliance check
   - Performance baseline comparison
   - Rollback on failure

### Deployment Strategy

- **Dev**: Automatic deployment on merge to `develop` branch
- **Test**: Automatic deployment with approval gate
- **Prod**: Manual approval with change management ticket



### Alert Rules

- **Critical**: Service unavailability, database connection failures
- **Warning**: High error rates, resource saturation, slow queries
- **Info**: Deployment events, configuration changes
